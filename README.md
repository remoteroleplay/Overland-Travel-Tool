# Overland-Travel-Tool
Overland Travel Tool for Forge hosted Foundry VTT

This file is raw JSON export of the scene. To set up a scene for you to modify for your use, do the following:

1. Download the JSON.
2. Create a fresh scene in your Forge/Foundry VTT. 
3. Import the JSON download
4. Set the background with the included image (Its large HD file)
5. Configure the screen dimensions to 4000 x 2400 to align the content
6. I've included the numbers, food, and water icons I built. To use these just import them as stretched images in the appropriate boxes.
7. To move the boxes, unlock them. :)
