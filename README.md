# Overland-Travel-Tool
Overland Travel Tool for Forge hosted Foundry VTT

This file is raw JSON export of the scene. To set up a scene for you to modify for your use, do the following:

1. Download the JSON.
2. Create a fresh scene in your Forge/Foundry VTT. 
3. Import the JSON download
4. Set the background with the icewind dale panorama image from the image file (or whatever you choose) <the panorama image is large HD file that I included in case you wanted to use it for other scenes. I am not the creator. Credit goes to u/W-R-St on reddit. (original post of file: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/k5bqkv/oc_art_a_painted_map_for_wotcs_icewind_dale/)
5. Configure the screen dimensions to 4000 x 2400 to align the content
6. I've included the numbers, food, and water icons I built for the tool. To use these just import them as stretched images in the appropriate boxes.
7. To move the boxes, unlock them. :) 

I may rethink this as I get smarter about how to set these up/build additional tools, but for now the interface layout is left as foundry art/shapes vs incorporating into background. This serves two purposes at the moment: 1) Folks can move them around/adjust vs having them embedded into image and 2) for those that are interested, the piece by piece set up/arrangement is easy to see when select the various parts of the interface build. This will show others how to replicate if they want to do from ground up. 

Give me a shout out if this is helpful/useful in your games.
